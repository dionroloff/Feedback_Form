# Redux Feedback Loop

### SETUP

```
npm install
npm run server
npm run client
```

### Description

> NOTE: As a baseline requirement, you must use Redux to store your data across views.

This is a multi-part form that allows users to leave feedback for today. 
There are 4 views for the form parts.
The parts:
- How are you feeling today?

- How well are you understanding the content?

- How well are you being supported?

- Any comments you want to leave?

## THE REVIEW COMPONENT

In addition to the multi-step form, the app displays the results of each step clearly and at all times. 

## SUBMIT THE FEEDBACK

The `Review` portion contains a submit button which when clicked will submit the completed feedback to the server.
