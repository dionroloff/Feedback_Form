This app is a feedback form modeled after Prime Digital Academy's system. Feedback will be collected over 4 views, and when all steps are complete, the app will save the feedback in the database. The review component, which is present at all times, will display the current feedback values and a conditionally-rendered submit button. 

### SETUP

```
npm install
npm run server
npm run client
```

### TECHNOLOGY USED

This app uses JavaScript's React framework, including Redux.js. The database was created using PostgreSQL.
